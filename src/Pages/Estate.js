                <h4>What is Estate Planning?</h4>
                <p>Set up ur shit before you die</p>
                <p>An <em>estate</em> is everything that contributes to the net worth of an individual, and includes both physical belongings as well as intangible assets. An individual's estate can be compromised of assets such as real estate, investments, cash, collectibles, or furnishings. Estate planning refers to the management of how these assets will be transferred to beneficiaries when an individual passes away. </p>

                <h4>What are the Benefits of Having a Will?</h4>
                <p>Kids get that $$ faster and won't argue about who gets what</p>
                <p>A will is a legal document that becomes operational upon death. You can adjust your will as many times as you desire throughout your lifetime and upon your passing, it is your last will that will go into effect. This document states how an individual prefers to have affairs handled and assets distrubted, as well as other personal details, such as how the funeral or memorial should be held or appointing guardianship of children. Without a will, the state court oversees distribution of assets, which could result in actions that negatively impact surviving loved ones.</p>

                <h4>Wills vs. Trusts -- How Do I Choose?</h4>
                <p>Have control over your estate before you die</p>
                <p>A trust becomes operational immediately upon creation, even while the indiviual is still alive. A designated person, or trustee, holds the responsibility of managing the trust's assets until it is transfered to the beneficiary. A living trust allows for quicker transfer of assets, as you are able to bypass the legal process of probate. All wills are required to go through probate, which can sometimes be a lengthy process, especially if family members contest the will. Trusts cannot be contested, however they can be a bit more tedious to set up and must be actively managed. It is possible for an individual to have both a will and a trust.</p>
