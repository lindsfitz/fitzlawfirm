                        The future is always unclear and presents unexpected roadblocks to each of us. Smart people plan for these to the greatest extent possible and are typically better prepared to deal with challenges to their health, to their finances and to their families. Ultimately our goal is to plan for each of these possible issues in the present before duress can weigh heavily on important decisions. There is no perfect plan but one that is well thought out and constructed can have dramatic effects in crucial ways.
