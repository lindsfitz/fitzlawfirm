# Timothy M. FitzGerald Estate Planning Website 

## About 

This application was created as a marketing website for an Estate Planning lawfirm. The site uses React and React Router to display the different components and redirect the user to the applications pages. 

## Description 

This application contains a homepage consisting of a header and details about the firm's offered services. The navigation and footer are persistent across all of the pages and include links to each page as well as contact info. The contact form allows users to reach out to the firm directly, and sends an email automatically to the contact at the firm. 

There is currently a login page for returning clients. This feature is still in development and will allow for users to access a customer dashboard that will include a chat feature to reach out to an advisor immediately as well as a place to upload documents. 


## Deployment

The application is live and hosted via a GoDaddy domain.
